[Music]

11
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,840
that is in last place is only five games

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,040
behind the team that is in first place

13
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,440
I'm muted by the way instead of three

14
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,840
points per sorry I was playing game five

15
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,200
that

16
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,599
is miles's team which is if you for

17
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,080
instance if miles team play Team who's

18
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
in first place right now and fiveo them

19
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,200
then they would go from last to First

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,239
and braw pro team would no longer in

21
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,640
first place so there's a huge amount of

22
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,200
points on the line today to incentivize

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,560

125
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,240
it now the question is can I can I use

126
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,479
it in like actual like on our players

127
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,440
you're probably going to get uh

128
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,919
obliterated by

129
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,120
eam hit purple I hit purple everybody

130
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,879
else I think you're good I

131
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,879
think e to try why the [ __ ] is he in my

132
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,680
ELO this man that man should be in the

133
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,639
should be facing slime or you yeah I I I

134
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,400
think they didn't expect him to get good

135
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,080
so fast cuz like it's his first time but

136
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,919
but he comes from fighting game games

137
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,199
like what yeah he's a dork he's a big

138
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,199
dork and he cares a lot which means you

139
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,280
should like put him you know what I mean

140
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,639
he should get like like a handicap or I

141
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,280
should get the handicap

142
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,479
yeah if you if you win one round it's

143
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,479
over exactly if I get one round I win

144
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,400
both sets that should be the hand

145
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,280

we're just waiting how are you so good

1287
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,599

01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:05,559
then just perfect

1290
01:07:05,559 --> 01:07:09,319
it you can't predict it because like I

1291
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:11,799
also throw in random Buton mashing so

1292
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:13,839
they can never predict

1293
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:17,160
it cuz it's like which one like they

1294
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,640
don't know when like is the real match

1295
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,799
you

1296
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:24,960
know if I throw in random button mashing

1297
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,119
they can't PR

1298
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:28,319
