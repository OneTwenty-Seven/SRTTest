fist okay yeah if I'm not that then I'm

3434
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,439
not doing

3435
03:13:28,399 --> 03:13:31,359
well oh it's over for me

3436
03:13:31,359 --> 03:13:33,359
Zoros

3437
03:13:33,359 --> 03:13:38,680

3438
03:13:45,720 --> 03:13:49,640
around um dead bro yeah yeah good good

3439
03:13:49,640 --> 03:13:52,920
try man I no let's try you know what we

3440
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:55,200
got the loss out of the way got it out

3441
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:56,479
of the

3442
03:13:56,479 --> 03:14:00,000
way look thisam hard trained against us

3443
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:03,160
so it makes sense you

3444
03:14:04,960 --> 03:14:08,680
know T although the streak is over that

3445
03:14:08,680 --> 03:14:11,160
gives us a chance to start a new streak

3446
03:14:11,160 --> 03:14:13,279
that's right A Better Way There It Is

3447
03:14:13,279 --> 03:14:16,880
there it is it was even longer yeah and

3448
03:14:16,880 --> 03:14:18,319
then look at this [ __ ] another [ __ ]

3449
03:14:18,319 --> 03:14:21,920
Alysa it's going to go all the way to

3450
03:14:21,920 --> 03:14:25,279
Evo makes you

3451
03:14:25,279 --> 03:14:28,279
think I can't believe it they went anti-

3452
03:14:28,279 --> 03:14:30,040
team

3453
03:14:30,040 --> 03:14:32,399
BP I mean they did that last time too

3454
03:14:32,399 --> 03:14:34,960
after we won the uh the round robin

3455
03:14:34,960 --> 03:14:37,600
everyone train up that's true chat Jack

3456
03:14:37,600 --> 03:14:39,600
Jesus fell on Friday he will rise on

3457
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:41,680
Sunday that's true

3458
03:14:41,680 --> 03:14:44,399
true it is the Lord's day it is the

3459
03:14:44,399 --> 03:14:47,760
Lord's day he died for our sins guys

3460
03:14:47,760 --> 03:14:49,319
yeah two round Robins probably hurt us

3461
03:14:49,319 --> 03:14:51,760
more cuz this happened to us last time

3462
03:14:51,760 --> 03:14:53,800
but round

3463
03:14:53,800 --> 03:14:58,319

03:26:12,160 --> 03:26:17,160
dumb you win nobody expects it

3652
03:26:17,160 --> 03:26:19,640
works every time this is why I won and

3653
03:26:19,640 --> 03:26:21,439
done because they realize I only know a

3654
03:26:21,439 --> 03:26:23,880
specific set of moves get ready for the

3655
03:26:23,880 --> 03:26:26,600
next battle but because it's so low yeah

3656
03:26:26,600 --> 03:26:33,520
it's so slow it's it's so slow so nobody

3657
03:26:33,520 --> 03:26:37,800
preps nobody expects

3658
03:26:38,040 --> 03:26:41,800
it that's so

3659
03:26:42,279 --> 03:26:48,239
true nobody expects ready for round

3660
03:26:56,880 --> 03:26:58,479

3661
03:26:58,479 --> 03:27:01,720

3664
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:11,399

3665
03:27:11,399 --> 03:27:13,680

03:27:24,160 --> 03:27:27,760
stand up yo

3671
03:27:28,160 --> 03:27:31,760
slime does she side step this no what's

3672
03:27:31,760 --> 03:27:35,880
up is it ready no what's up what's up

3673
03:27:35,880 --> 03:27:38,880
uh dude this is a pretty stressful man

3674
03:27:38,880 --> 03:27:40,359
so it's not going to be easy to do this

3675
03:27:40,359 --> 03:27:42,199
stuff you just learned yesterday the

3676
03:27:42,199 --> 03:27:44,920
next day so I wouldn't wouldn't worry

3677
03:27:44,920 --> 03:27:47,399
about it too much honestly [ __ ] the Gin

3678
03:27:47,399 --> 03:27:49,760
man it's just like yeah it's definitely

3679
03:27:49,760 --> 03:27:52,080
he's annoying character yeah 100% I

3680
03:27:52,080 --> 03:27:56,080
think that I was oh counter that I was

3681
03:27:56,080 --> 03:27:57,680
just really trying to focus on defense

3682
03:27:57,680 --> 03:27:59,920
which is like if you're wrong when

3683
03:27:59,920 --> 03:28:01,680
you're defending it's really bad if

3684
03:28:01,680 --> 03:28:02,960
you're wrong when you're attacking I

3685
03:28:02,960 --> 03:28:06,399
feel like it's it's way more at this

3686
03:28:06,399 --> 03:28:08,680
level yeah you would you would dug and

3687
03:28:08,680 --> 03:28:11,040
he would launch goodbye to me for three

3688
03:28:11,040 --> 03:28:13,359
that axe kick he has yeah and he was

3689
03:28:13,359 --> 03:28:15,199
also doing it like kind of raw like I

3690
03:28:15,199 --> 03:28:17,160
would go for a grab and he just rip it

3691
03:28:17,160 --> 03:28:18,640
and I'm like okay well if I it just

3692
03:28:18,640 --> 03:28:22,160
works block a little more cuz they don't

3693
03:28:22,160 --> 03:28:23,600
expect it so I don't know I don't know

3694
03:28:23,600 --> 03:28:26,479
how much of it was like they just or

3695
03:28:26,479 --> 03:28:27,479
this guy's

3696
03:28:27,479 --> 03:28:30,720
like he's all right play I think he was

3697
03:28:30,720 --> 03:28:32,439
taking some rounds off the M uh

3698
03:28:32,439 --> 03:28:35,040
yesterday was it fight I think it's that

3699
03:28:35,040 --> 03:28:36,760
about the Fang the Fang way who also

3700
03:28:36,760 --> 03:28:39,359
destroyed me so I just got those guys

3701
03:28:39,359 --> 03:28:41,359
are honestly I don't think they should

3702
03:28:41,359 --> 03:28:43,760
even there should even be in this tier

3703
03:28:43,760 --> 03:28:48,319
uh the Fang specifically but uh it's

3704
03:28:48,319 --> 03:28:50,319
cool I mean we can watch them like

3705
03:28:50,319 --> 03:28:51,800
tonight or tomorrow if you want some

3706
03:28:51,800 --> 03:28:55,000
matches if it

3707
03:28:55,000 --> 03:28:58,479
helps I think what will help is uh

3708
03:28:58,479 --> 03:29:01,760
actually playing like play your gin or

3709
03:29:01,760 --> 03:29:05,199
something I can definitely play expect I

3710
03:29:05,199 --> 03:29:08,239
told you fine that's what will help we

3711
03:29:08,239 --> 03:29:10,560
can do that too I think that if I lose

3712
03:29:10,560 --> 03:29:12,359
this it's fine I made a statement she

3713
03:29:12,359 --> 03:29:15,120
hates me I might have like if I lose

3714
03:29:15,120 --> 03:29:18,560
this I might have lost the game but like

3715
03:29:18,560 --> 03:29:21,080
I want the mental Warfare

3716
03:29:21,080 --> 03:29:24,160
way sounds like it's actually happening

3717
03:29:24,160 --> 03:29:28,880
the way you said it the the tone of the

3718
03:29:29,479 --> 03:29:32,760
voice I want a mental War it's all about

3719
