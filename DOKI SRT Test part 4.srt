4610
04:21:30,199 --> 04:21:32,319
want to talk about I don't want to tell

4611

you guys how grinded that [ __ ] Wednesday

4612
04:21:35,279 --> 04:21:36,920
actually mattered three-point diff

4613
04:21:36,920 --> 04:21:38,520
that's crazy literally a one game

4614
04:21:38,520 --> 04:21:40,279
difference that literally literally

4615
04:21:40,279 --> 04:21:43,279
means everyone who won like

4616
04:21:43,279 --> 04:21:45,880
every single everyone matter good

4617
04:21:45,880 --> 04:21:49,479
[ __ ] [ __ ] let's go this is so sick

4618
04:21:49,479 --> 04:21:51,479
because like everyone on the team like

4619
04:21:51,479 --> 04:21:53,920
it contributes

4620
04:21:53,920 --> 04:21:56,359
not oh I can hear Josh talking so so

4621
04:21:56,359 --> 04:21:59,479
when is someone going to name drop

4622
04:21:59,479 --> 04:22:02,600
super ready a lot bigger streak Than

4623
04:22:02,600 --> 04:22:05,040
Ready W more

4624
04:22:05,040 --> 04:22:07,760
game I love the guy but I I feel like

4625
04:22:07,760 --> 04:22:09,680
the doky bird special the alley kick

4626
04:22:09,680 --> 04:22:12,520
special that's oh yeah soon as we learn

4627
04:22:12,520 --> 04:22:14,880
block that Yoshi the spin a Roy [ __ ]

4628
04:22:14,880 --> 04:22:17,680
it's easy yeah the moment I block that

4629
04:22:17,680 --> 04:22:20,840
it's over I can alley kick

4630
04:22:24,080 --> 04:22:26,040
forever you think they're going to learn

4631
04:22:26,040 --> 04:22:28,960
how to block the alley kick guys we were

4632
04:22:28,960 --> 04:22:31,960
only two points away from first also

4633
04:22:31,960 --> 04:22:34,640
[ __ ] done it yeah if we won one more set

4634
04:22:34,640 --> 04:22:36,199
against but I mean first or second

4635
04:22:36,199 --> 04:22:37,680
doesn't yeah it doesn't matter it

4636
04:22:37,680 --> 04:22:39,640
doesn't it doesn't matter right we're

4637
04:22:39,640 --> 04:22:41,040
just on the other side of the bracket

4638
04:22:41,040 --> 04:22:44,439
from my understanding

4639
04:22:45,080 --> 04:22:49,520
don't does it matter IFK our third seed

4640
04:22:49,520 --> 04:22:52,479
then we just for1 them so like you know

4641
04:22:52,479 --> 04:22:54,080
not in a bad

4642
04:22:54,080 --> 04:22:55,880
spot

4643
04:22:55,880 --> 04:22:58,359
okay good I'm going to ask I'm going to

4644
04:22:58,359 --> 04:23:00,080
ask stage one see if anyone wants to

4645
04:23:00,080 --> 04:23:03,560
play t and also uh we don't have once

4646
04:23:03,560 --> 04:23:05,239
the bracket comes out we don't have to

4647
04:23:05,239 --> 04:23:08,279
focus on like five characters cuz we we

4648
04:23:08,279 --> 04:23:12,199
we get a buy yeah maybe we might with

4649
04:23:12,199 --> 04:23:14,560
the loser bracket I don't know how that

4650
04:23:14,560 --> 04:23:16,800
works have to prepare yeah for whatever

4651
04:23:16,800 --> 04:23:18,159
comes

4652
04:23:18,159 --> 04:23:20,640
up yeah I think it's mathematically will

4653
04:23:20,640 --> 04:23:23,279
be less characters to focus on the

4654
04:23:23,279 --> 04:23:25,920
moment you teach me how to block I'm

4655
04:23:25,920 --> 04:23:28,720
unstoppable yeah know yeah we'll do all

4656
04:23:28,720 --> 04:23:30,880
that like it'll be a read but by

4657
04:23:30,880 --> 04:23:32,720
definition we have to lab against like

4658
04:23:32,720 --> 04:23:35,520
at least one less

4659

donation drive for a millionaire after

4682

04:24:34,359 --> 04:24:37,600
I'm not going to use my own

4684

each of us choked at least once guys

4691
04:24:56,840 --> 04:25:00,080
it's okay it's a team

4692
04:25:00,080 --> 04:25:02,640
effort second though as a team effort

4693
04:25:02,640 --> 04:25:05,239

4695
04:25:08,560 --> 04:25:13,119
saying it over super pay for his own

4696
04:25:13,119 --> 04:25:15,800
ticket I gave away my first ticket cuz I

4697
04:25:15,800 --> 04:25:18,000
already had a Evo [ __ ] like I already

4698
04:25:18,000 --> 04:25:20,880
had a ticket oh what the [ __ ] yeah I was

4699
04:25:20,880 --> 04:25:22,359
like here sjm just give it to someone

4700
04:25:22,359 --> 04:25:26,040
else sjm saves money if uh if we win

4701
04:25:26,040 --> 04:25:28,960
yeah so it's in his interest to rig the

4702
04:25:28,960 --> 04:25:30,760
bracket oh that's true that's true oh

4703
04:25:30,760 --> 04:25:32,840
look at how close we were dude oh my oh

4704
04:25:32,840 --> 04:25:37,399
my God we were so close that's crazy if

4705
04:25:37,399 --> 04:25:39,040
B you know knock going wi not going to

4706
04:25:39,040 --> 04:25:41,840
happen but if we don't get top two we'll

4707
04:25:41,840 --> 04:25:44,960
all pitch get Doki to Evo too yeah

4708
04:25:44,960 --> 04:25:47,199
because I mean clutch master Doki

4709
04:25:47,199 --> 04:25:50,279
literally every match mattered in Doki

4710
04:25:50,279 --> 04:25:57,359
clutch that [ __ ] wa the my set counted

4711

4718
04:26:17,359 --> 04:26:19,040

4770
04:28:38,760 --> 04:28:40,880
in the finals we're definitely going to

4771
04:28:40,880 --> 04:28:42,600
have our new pc

4772
04:28:42,600 --> 04:28:47,479
and the shackles will be off for

4773
04:28:47,479 --> 04:28:52,239
real and we got red rank on stream

4774
04:28:52,239 --> 04:28:56,479
too guys we got red rank on

4775
04:28:56,479 --> 04:29:00,720
stream to be fair I feel like I've been

4776
04:29:00,720 --> 04:29:02,880
I honestly feel like I brute forced a

4777
04:29:02,880 --> 04:29:05,560
red rank because all I did was just do

4778
04:29:05,560 --> 04:29:09,960
the moves I know and then leave

4779
04:29:12,359 --> 04:29:13,399
I

4780
04:29:13,399 --> 04:29:16,560
just I just do like the most tilting

4781
04:29:16,560 --> 04:29:19,600
[ __ ] moves that nobody has ever seen

4782
04:29:19,600 --> 04:29:22,279
before I call it the Doki special with

4783
04:29:22,279 --> 04:29:26,680
five alley kicks and then into a hop

4784
04:29:26,720 --> 04:29:31,359
kick red red is red these people in

4785
04:29:31,359 --> 04:29:36,040
those rigs did not know what they

4786
04:29:37,159 --> 04:29:40,199
saw the one I'm pretty sure I tilted a

4787
04:29:40,199 --> 04:29:42,000
lot of people I was so surprised

4788
04:29:42,000 --> 04:29:44,199
surprised that the match against SK was

4789
04:29:44,199 --> 04:29:47,000
so close because she had so many hours

4790
04:29:47,000 --> 04:29:49,080
ahead of me all I I like hard grinded

4791
04:29:49,080 --> 04:29:51,520
the last this week but like ESI still

4792
04:29:51,520 --> 04:29:53,279
had so many hours ahead of me like

4793
04:29:53,279 --> 04:29:56,119
everybody had so many hours ahead of me

4794
04:29:56,119 --> 04:29:58,920
um throughout this tournament so I felt

4795
04:29:58,920 --> 04:30:01,520
like I definitely grew a lot in such a

4796
04:30:01,520 --> 04:30:04,880
short amount of time and uh and I did I

4797
04:30:04,880 --> 04:30:09,080
don't like I don't def I just go in

4798
04:30:09,359 --> 04:30:13,840
Yolo the monkey

4799
04:30:14,159 --> 04:30:16,439
I feel like I caught up really fast in

4800
04:30:16,439 --> 04:30:18,319
the short amount of hours I think I have

4801
04:30:18,319 --> 04:30:20,960
like 30 hours in total at the moment in

4802
04:30:20,960 --> 04:30:24,960
Tekken for now but I'm like I um and

4803
04:30:24,960 --> 04:30:26,600
it's my first fighting game so I'm

4804
04:30:26,600 --> 04:30:28,840
really happy with my progress so far

4805
04:30:28,840 --> 04:30:30,640
like I never expected to get red rank at

4806
04:30:30,640 --> 04:30:34,720
all so I'm super happy with my

4807
04:30:34,720 --> 04:30:37,920
progress and I honestly think the moment

4808
04:30:37,920 --> 04:30:40,080
I learn how to block it's [ __ ] over

4809
04:30:40,080 --> 04:30:43,080
for everybody that's that's my only

4810
04:30:43,080 --> 04:30:45,960
problem the moment I learn the block and

4811
04:30:45,960 --> 04:30:49,760
I become more patient it's over I I I

4812
04:30:49,760 --> 04:30:52,720
figured it out because I win the mental

4813
04:30:52,720 --> 04:30:56,640
game like I I win the mind games off of

4814
04:30:56,640 --> 04:30:58,800
people because when they fight against

4815
04:30:58,800 --> 04:31:01,600
me it's so I can feel the rage I can

4816
04:31:01,600 --> 04:31:03,760
feel people being really angry when

4817
04:31:03,760 --> 04:31:05,319
