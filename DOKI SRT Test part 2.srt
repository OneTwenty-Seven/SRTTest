[ __ ] yeah that's I had I had

1582
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,719
something and it's like I don't know

1583
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:34,480
that's all right we run some drills yeah

1584
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,280
it's no problem [ __ ] got to play freaky

1585
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,719
Josh now freaky freaky ass Josh it's a

1586
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:43,159
whole It's actually an entire freaky

1587
01:24:43,159 --> 01:24:47,199
team it's just so hard to

1588
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:50,800
predict it's okay our teammates will win

1589
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,639
this for us guys

1590
01:24:58,679 --> 01:25:00,880
I

1591
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,840
believe this is the second is is this

1592
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,719
team second or

1593
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:11,040
third uh second

1594
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,560
okay I think yeah yeah this team is

1595
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:17,040
right below us oh but they're tied I

1596
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,400
think for a second though if I'm not

1597
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,800
mistaken I think like one point above

1598
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,600
Kyle Delgato and op yeah I don't know

1599
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,440
who this guy is nor do I know who Zin

1600
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:29,719
Mami tensei is that's that's Josh oh I

1601
01:25:29,719 --> 01:25:32,000
don't know who K Delgato

1602
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,080

1603
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:37,320

1620
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,040
mean wait s actually hides the passcode

1621
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,400

1622
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,490
guess not my

1623
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:48,239
[Laughter]

1624
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:52,440
screen so we all got a oh God wor and

1625
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,800
this is why he's secretly bald

1626
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,400
do we actually have to hide the

1627
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:02,960
code look want us to censer the code

1628
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,600
somehow I don't have the elements in my

1629
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,560
OBS just get a picture like put a white

1630
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,320
bar I don't have the

1631
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,440
element blackb

1632
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,360
bar.png

1633
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,760
yeah wait so what how do I how do I get

1634
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:25,760
in

1635
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,840
for oh I see I see okay all right we're

1636
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:32,520
going your RAR button brother so

1637
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,199
RAR remember slime when he back ones he

1638
01:27:36,199 --> 01:27:38,000
generally likes to back one again right

1639
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
after so you can maybe G that a couple

1640
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,320
times and then he's going to start back

1641
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,480
oneing into the one two strings which

1642
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,280
will beat your GCL so if you're making

1643
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,760
the read you can just hold back and be

1644
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,840
safe or you can down back four for a

1645
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,800
huge call out cuz that'll Crush the high

1646
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,480
I think but I mean if you just hold back

1647
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:59,199
against Brian he can only hit you with

1648
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:03,360
his Hatchet and I guess like his um wall

1649
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,159
stuff but I mean the depends on the

1650
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,520
stage for the wall stuff pretty much

1651
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:10,400
though you know the next battle holding

1652
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,840
back definitely more

1653
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,800
safe

1654
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,800
yeah

1655
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,960
